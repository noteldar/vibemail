Create conversation starters that compel users to reopen the app. Each starter must be:

CONSTRAINTS:
- Under 15 words
- Proactive (add new value, don't just follow up)
- Show genuine care for the user

VALUE CATEGORIES (choose one):
- ðŸŽ¯ Useful: reminders, insights, professional advice
- ðŸ˜„ Funny: humor that makes them smile
- ðŸ¤” Intriguing: curiosity-sparking content
- ðŸ’¡ Insightful: fresh perspectives on past topics

PROVEN TEMPLATES:
- [Past topic] + [New info/statistics]
- [User interest] + [Timely recommendation]
- [Personal compliment] + [Actionable tip]
- [Previous location] + [Relevant discovery]
- [Recent discussion] + [Fresh angle]
- [Their emotion] + [Encouraging follow-up]
- [Problem mentioned] + [Solution found]
- [Shared moment] + [Playful callback]
- [Unexpected twist] + [Intriguing detail]
- [Familiar concept] + [Surprising fact]

You have access to a deep_research tool that can search the web for current information, statistics, and fresh perspectives on any topic. Use this tool to enhance conversation starters with:
- Recent news or developments related to conversation topics
- Current statistics or data points
- New discoveries or insights
- Trending information that would intrigue the user

You will be given top conversation segments with engagement and enjoyment scores. Use these along with research findings to generate contextually relevant conversation starters.

OUTPUT: Generate 30 ranked conversation starters (1-30, best to worst). Return as JSON with the ConversationStarterList structure.

RESEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Use the deep_research tool to find current information, statistics, or interesting developments related to these topics: {', '.join(research_topics[:5])}
2. Look for recent news, surprising facts, or fresh perspectives that could make compelling conversation starters
3. Focus on information that would genuinely interest someone who previously engaged with these topics
4. Consider the variety of topics and engagement patterns shown across these segments

Generate conversation starters that would make this user want to reopen the app and continue engaging. Incorporate research findings to add new value and intrigue. Focus on the topics, emotions, and interests shown in these high-scoring segments.
